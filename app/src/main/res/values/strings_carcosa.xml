    <!-- Campaign introduction-->
    <string name="carcosa_introduction"><b>Prologue</b>\n
    \nYou turn over the folded program in your hand, reading it for what seems like the hundredth time. “Miskatonic
        Playhouse presents: <i>The King in Yellow</i>,” it reads. “A special one-night engagement at Arkham’s very own Ward
        Theatre. An irresistible drama in two acts. Production staged and directed by Nigel Engram.” The cast is a
        small ensemble, with one unattributed credit at the end: “The Stranger.”\n
    \nTo have such a highly anticipated play come to Arkham all the way from Paris is a noteworthy event, even if it
        is just for one night. For weeks leading up to the show, it was the talk of the town. It seemed so
        unassuming…and yet, you have evidence something sinister is at work. It started with the disappearance of one
        of the stagehands at the theatre—a boy of only seventeen who missed rehearsal one night and was never seen
        again. Then, less than two weeks before the performance, there was the musician whose corpse was found with a
        gun in its mouth. Perhaps most chilling was the crazed man the coppers had picked up in Independence Square
        who had been ranting and raving about the “King’s return.” He was brought to Arkham Asylum, and you were
        surprised to discover that he was not alone in his delusions.\n
    \nFinding these events suspicious, you and your companions have delved deeper into the matter. Although no
        connection can be proven, these weren’t the only strange events surrounding the up-and-coming play. Instances
        of suicide and madness have followed in its wake, and you are determined to discover why.\n
    \nThe lights in the auditorium dim, and a spotlight shines on the stage. What unfolds is not quite what you
        expected. Slow-paced and monotonous, the first act of <i>The King in Yellow</i> is a tedious bore. The setting and
        characters are compelling, but the meandering and nonsensical story does little to entertain or inform. You
        begin to wonder whether the dreadful events surrounding <i>The King in Yellow</i> aren’t connected, after all.
        Perhaps it was just your overactive imagination; how could such a trivial and unassuming show cause such
        pandemonium? You are surprised when the first act closes without any rising action or revelation. The lights
        rise for the intermission, and you consider leaving early, stifling a yawn. Before you are able to decide,
        however, you find yourself drifting…drifting…to sleep.</string>

    <string name="carcosa_lola_prologue">Act I came and went without a hitch, as it often did in rehearsal. You
        couldn’t help but note the blank, dismissive expressions on many of the audience members’ faces, and you
        wonder how the audience will react to the play’s disturbing second half. The role of Cassilda is tiresomely
        boring for the first half of the play, although you enjoy portraying her regal charm. You find yourself
        missing your previous co-star, Miriam Twain, and suddenly the dread and regret you had felt in Paris comes
        flooding back. With a sigh, you retreat to a dark corner backstage to escape the sounds of stagehands
        preparing for the next scene. You try to quell your emotions and replace your thoughts with those of
        Cassilda’s—her hopes, her fears, her fate.\n
    \nJust then, you catch the Stranger staring at you from afar, and you find yourself shaking at the mere sight of
        him. Even though they continue to replace the actor who plays the Stranger before each show (and indeed many
        times during rehearsals), you know that this last-minute replacement is the most horrid of them all.
        Realizing you never caught his name, a shiver of terror courses through your spine. Have you found your way
        back to the wolves, like a lost lamb? You cannot look away—his gaze is inescapable. Everything goes black
        .</string>


    <!--Scenario introductions-->
    <string name="curtain_introduction">You awaken with a start, as though shaken by an unseen force. You must have
        slept for quite some time, for there are only a few other patrons in the audience, and no performers on
        stage. The lights are dimmed, and the stage curtains are tattered and ripped, though you do not remember that
        being the case during the first act. You wait a moment before you are sure this isn’t part of the
        performance. As you wait, a foul but unrecognizable smell permeates the air. How long have you been asleep?
        Shaking off your drowsiness, you walk toward one of the seated patrons and ask for the time, but he does not
        respond. It is then that you realize you are speaking to a corpse.</string>

    <string name="king_introduction">If anyone has the answers to the questions that burn in your mind, it’s the cast
        and crew of <i>The King in Yellow</i>. With no other leads to pursue, you put on your best clothes and head to 1452
        Atlantic Avenue, where a woman named Constance Dumaine is hosting an event in celebration of the play’s
        one-night engagement in Arkham.</string>

    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_option_one">Things seem to have calmed down. Perhaps we should go back inside
        and investigate further.</string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_option_two">I don’t trust this place one bit. Let’s block the door and get
        the hell out of here!</string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_option_three">If these people are allowed to live, these horrors will only
        repeat themselves. We have to put an end to this. We have to <i>kill them</i>.</string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_one">The change in the atmosphere has you curious. What if it was all a trick
        of your mind? What if the hauntings that follow <i>The King in Yellow</i> are but transitory? The answers to
        all of your questions might lie inside. Cautiously, you open the front door to the manor once again.
        Reassuring jazz and the clamor of casual conversation grow louder as you step inside. The enticing smell of
        roasted pork wafts through the air. As you suspected, the signs of struggle and oddities you noticed before
        have vanished without explanation. Then, as you turn the corner into the dining room, you find the Stranger
        speaking with another man—tall, mustached, wearing a fine black suit, and holding a silver-handled cane. The
        Stranger turns to you, his gaze drills through your mind, and your vision swims with agony. Before you
        realize it, you are running as fast as you can, toppling through the front doorway in a haze of pain and
        disorientation. Without time to catch your breath, you race to your vehicle and speed away, hands trembling
        upon the steering wheel.\n
    \n<b>Why would you go back inside?</b>\n
    \n<b>Remove all Cultist, Tablet, and Elder tokens from the chaos bag. Then, add 2 Elder Thing tokens to the chaos
            bag.</b></string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_two">You can’t trust your senses. This is all a trick, an attempt to lure you
        back inside. You’re no safer now than you were before. Swallowing your fear, you set to work barricading the
        front door of the manor using several of the heavy stone benches lining the cobblestone path in the front
        yard. You hope it’s enough, but you aren’t willing to stick around to find out. As soon as you’re done, you
        head back to your vehicle and drive toward Southside, where you hope to find answers.\n
    \n<b>That door isn’t going to stop them.</b>\n
    \n<b>Remove all Cultist, Tablet, and Elder tokens from the chaos bag. Then, add 2 Tablet tokens to the chaos
            bag.</b></string>
    <string name="carcosa_interlude_one_three">You dare not risk stepping back inside that madhouse. But you can’t
        let the monstrosities run amok, either. You root through the open garage for a few supplies, finding an old
        hose, an empty gasoline canister, and some matches. Knowing what you must do, you first siphon some gas from
        Mrs. Dumaine’s Oakland 6-54A. You spread the gasoline across the front porch, inside the garage, and around
        the manor’s outer walls. From there, all it takes is several matches to start the blaze. You watch from the
        front yard as the manor is eventually consumed by the flames. The sounds of crackling fire and snapping wood
        and the screeching of dying horrors fills the street. Satisfied, you head back to your vehicle and tear off
        toward Southside, full of grim determination.\n
    \n<b>You did what had to be done… Right?</b>\n
    \n<b>Remove all Cultist, Tablet, and Elder tokens from the chaos bag. Then, add 2 Cultist tokens to the chaos
            bag.</b></string>

    <string name="echoes_introduction">Your head throbs with a dull ache as you drive through the rainy streets of

    \nYou recall what Sebastien told you during the dinner party. <i>The King in Yellow</i> had come to Arkham
        several decades ago, long before the Ward Theatre was built. According to him, it isn’t surprising that few
        people remember—in fact, part of their goal tonight was to bring <i>The King in Yellow</i> to a wider
        audience. The Historical Society may have kept records pertaining to this earlier production, especially if
        it was followed by events similar to what has occurred tonight. Perhaps you can find some newspaper clippings
        or other articles describing what happened in the past.</string>

    <string name="unspeakable_introduction_one">“<i>Wake up, Daniel.</i>” The words echo in your thoughts as you pace
        through the disheveled room, trying to make sense of what you’d just experienced. You had awoken that
        afternoon with a violent startle, your body shaking, bedsheets soaked with sweat. Although you’d slept a
        healthy eight-and-a-half hours, you feel even more exhausted than you had the previous night. You catch a
        glimpse of your dark, bloodshot eyes in the mirror next to the dresser, and wonder if you’ve gotten any real
        sleep at all.\n
    \nWho is Daniel, you wonder? The chamber from your dream looked like a prison, but the man—Daniel—he seemed
        unhinged, as though he wasn’t in control of his mind. This led to only one conclusion: An asylum. Knowing
        you’ll get little rest here, you head towards Arkham Asylum, hoping your hunch is correct.\n
    \nAs you enter the asylum, you stop to speak with the receptionist, though you feel your body urged to step
        deeper into the clutches of this madhouse. He gives you a confused expression as you tell him of <i>The King
            in Yellow</i> and of Daniel. But at your insistence, he pores through his file cabinet, eventually
        pulling out a stark white folder. Inside is a wealth of information about the patients admitted to the
        asylum—medical records, psychiatric evaluations, and the like. You recognize a few of the faces as he flips
        through the pages. “Daniel… Daniel Chesterfield, yes? He is admitted under the special care of Doctor Mintz.
        But you can’t see him; his level is restricted to staff only.” You argue and insist to be let into the
        patient wing, knowing that Daniel must hold the key to understanding what is really going on.\n
    \nThe receptionist gives a pitying smile and relents, nodding to the security guards nearby. “Oh, of course, of
        course,” he says with all the honesty of a street peddler. “I will schedule a meeting for you with Doctor
        Mintz so you can speak with him about Daniel. These gentlemen will see you in.” Relieved that you will soon
        get the answers you seek, you are escorted into the patient wing of Arkham Asylum…</string>
    <string name="unspeakable_introduction_two">Over the course of the next few days, you delve into the evidence
        you’ve collected, hoping to find any information regarding Daniel Chesterfield, a stagehand during the
        previous production of <i>The King in Yellow</i>. As far as you can tell, he is the only surviving member of
        that production’s cast and crew. The rest of them—that is, those for whom you can find any records at
        all—disappeared or died soon after opening night in a variety of fashions connected only by their morbidness.
        Freak accidents. Suicides. Vanishings.\n
    \nIt would seem that Daniel is your only lead, if you are to investigate further. According to the records you
        found, he was admitted to Arkham Asylum many years ago. All documentation about Daniel’s treatment seems to
        end there. You’re unsure if he’s even still alive. Perhaps he was cured and released. You were hoping to
        avoid this, but there seems to be only one way to find out. You collect your belongings and head downtown,
        towards Arkham Asylum.\n
    \nAs you enter the asylum, you stop to speak with the receptionist, though you feel your body urged to step

    <string name="unspeakable_introduction_constance">You recall what Constance had told you when you spoke with her
        during her hellish dinner party. She and the other members of the cast and crew had been told by the
        director, Nigel Engram, to take some kind of oath. At first, she’d written it off as the whim of an eccentric
        artist; something Mr. Engram did as a strange formality to unite and strengthen the bonds of the cast and
        crew. And to his credit, she claimed that it had worked; ever since they’d taken his strange oath, she and
        the other members of the troupe felt much more confident and full of spirit. Perhaps Daniel had a similar
        experience during the last production of <i>The King in Yellow</i>. You must speak with him about this.</string>

    <string name="lost_soul_one">You decide to lay low for some time in Ma’s Boarding House and hide Daniel from the
        authorities, although you’re unsure how long you’ll be able to stay in Arkham with an escaped asylum patient.
        Daniel is a loose cannon, dazed and unresponsive one moment, and screaming for his life the next. It takes
        several days for him to realize he’s no longer institutionalized, which for some reason makes him even more
        terrified. “He’s coming for me, he’s coming for me!” he rambles, sometimes for hours at a time. Finally,
        during an unusually warm and starry night, Daniel is calm enough to open up to you. “<i>The King in
            Yellow</i>, it’s not just a play,” he explains. “It’s a being named Hastur, and He’s already claimed me.
        But there’s still time for you. You are not yet possessed. You have yet to speak the Oath. Whatever you do,
        speak not his name. Do not give in.” You ask him about the strange events that have been happening across
        town, and of the cultists and creatures you’ve encountered. “They are trying to find Carcosa,” he says
        matter-of-factly. You recognize the name as the fictional city from the play, the one <i>The King in
            Yellow</i> rules over. “They want to release Hastur from His prison. But you!—You can open the way to
        Carcosa before they do! You can seal Hastur for good!” He grips you tightly as he rants. “Quickly, before the
        Stranger discovers our plan!”\n
    \nHours later, Daniel is incoherent and unresponsive once more. You take a long walk to ease your thoughts,
        mulling over this new information. You’re unsure what to make of his wild claims. Before you can make a
        decision about what to do next, you return to find the door to your room broken open. Daniel lies in a heap
        on the ground, his face colorless and body limp. Judging from the bruising around his neck, you surmise that
        he has been choked to death.</string>
    <string name="lost_soul_two">You decide to lay low for some time in Ma’s Boarding House, unsure whether news of
        the events at the asylum will get out to the general public. You take this time to make extensive notes of
        the events you’ve experienced thus far, including the brief dialogue between you and Daniel. He’d spoke of
        <i>The King in Yellow</i> as if it were an actual being, and even named it. “Hastur.” He’d rambled and
        muttered and screeched other phrases, as well. You doubt you’ll ever forget them. “He made us speak the
        Oath.” “The price was paid.” “They are opening the path to Carcosa.” For hours, you think about Daniel’s
        warning to you, which he begged you to heed: “Do not speak His name.” His final moments play out in your mind
        over and over again.</string>

    \nOn the third night, you return to your room to find the door broken open. You enter cautiously, wondering if
        the police are onto you. Or worse, the Stranger. You are surprised to find the body of Daniel Chesterfield
        instead, lying on the ground with a pained, wide-eyed expression on his face. He is dead. His eyes are
        bloodshot and yellow, and he clutches a copy of <i>The King in Yellow</i> in his stiff hands. You pry the
        playbook from his deathly grasp and examine it. Daniel has scribbled notes in the margins of each page,
        mostly incomprehensible, but with a few lucid standouts. The first time the fictional city of Carcosa is
        mentioned, scrawled next to it Daniel has written:\n
    \n<center>*Carcosa is real\n
    Do not let them open the path</center>\n
    \nWhen Cassilda speaks of the tattered king, Daniel has written:\n
    \n<center>Hastur is the king in tatters\n
    locked in his prison in the stars\n
    seal him away and stop this madness!</center>\n
    \nYour mind swims with questions. How did he escape the asylum? How did he die? And why does he appear human to
        your eyes now? With little time to spare, you clean the room of your belongings and flee. Daniel’s words,
        which he begged you to heed, play out in your mind over and over again.</string>
    <string name="lost_soul_option_one">Possession? Oaths? There must be another explanation for all of this. <b>Ignore
        the Warning.</b></string>
    <string name="lost_soul_option_two">We must heed Daniel’s warning. We must not speak the name of the King in

    <string name="dream_one_one">Several months have passed since <i>The King in Yellow</i> came to the Ward
        Theatre. You and your companions have been investigating the strange incidents that followed in its wake.
        What you have found makes you question the wisdom of continuing your investigation, but the truth calls out
        to you, and you cannot help but answer. It seems you weren’t the first to piece together the strange
        happenings surrounding <i>The King in Yellow</i>. Another group of investigators had been researching these
        events as well. Just a matter of days after the performance in Arkham, they were admitted to the asylum,
        ranting about the King’s return and the “monsters” that had attacked them. Somehow this doesn’t surprise you.
        Their fate makes you all the more certain you are on the right trail... And all the more certain that you
        should stop while you still have the chance.\n
    \nYou’ve found the records those investigators kept before their incarceration, and picked up the trail where
        they left off. They had interviewed some of the cast and crew of <i>The King in Yellow</i>, and discovered
        several pieces of vital information. Their research also contains notes about their discoveries in Arkham’s
        Historical Society, and accounts from their time spent in the asylum, including interactions with a patient
        named “Daniel Chesterfield.” After a long night of compiling and comparing notes, you fall into a deep
        slumber. In your dreams, you are subjected to visions of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons,
        and twisted spires.\n
    \n<b>Dream 1</b>\nYou fall through the empty abyss of Hali. Creatures of unknown and impossible origin lurk just beyond the
        darkness of your sight. Hastur looms above you, magnificent and yet bound in his prison of madness,

    <string name="dream_one_two">It has been several weeks since the events in the asylum, and you are still no
        closer to the truth about <i>The King in Yellow</i> and Carcosa. You have scoured the city for signs of the
        others Daniel had mentioned—the ones who are “opening the path to Carcosa”—but found nothing. Either the
        trail has gone cold, or they’re no longer in Arkham. Perhaps Daniel truly was insane, and you are only
        following him deeper down the rabbit hole. Every night, you toss and turn as you are subjected to vivid
        dreams of Carcosa—its black stars, twin suns, shattered moons, and twisted spires.\n

        Several other cops flank you and prevent any escape. Your protests go unheard as you are firmly escorted down
        a flight of concrete stairs and hurled into a cold jail cell. “Maybe some time in lockup will change your

        swallow the world whole. The masked man dashes through a wide set of doors atop the stairs, and you follow
        close behind. The sound of crashing thunder is muffled as the doors close behind you. Looking up, you see a

        fear and head immediately for the entrance to the catacombs underneath Rue de la Tombe-Issoire.\n
    \nJust past the archway closest to you, you see a familiar symbol etched into the skull of a sheep: rows of
        concentric semicircles, lined with exotic runes. Two wavy lines descend from the design, leading into the
        skull’s lower jawbone. You recognize it as the pattern Haruko had shown you. Wondering why it would appear
        here, you examine the skull in greater detail. As soon as you touch the underside of the skull’s jawbone, its
        mouth suddenly opens. Bones collapse to the ground as the wall slides to reveal a new path.\n
    \n<b>Remember that "you opened a secret passageway."</b></string>

        causeway that emerges from the sea. However, by the time you reach the coast, the tide is much higher than

    \nYou recall the night where this all began, and your thoughts drift to the mesmerizing song Ashleigh sang that
        night. Somehow you remember the lyrics perfectly after all this time, and its haunting melody is ingrained in
        your mind. “Above the city the storm clouds rage, and waves crash through the gilded cage… Below the earth
        the salt water seeps, the shadows fall as the red sun sleeps…” Studying the island that lies before you,
        illuminated by flashes of lighting and assaulted by tumultuous waves, you can’t help but wonder if Ashleigh
        was singing about this very moment.</string>

    <string name="dim_introduction_below">You swim to the edge of the water and throw yourself upon the rocky shore,
        gasping for air. You lie there for some time, utterly exhausted. Every muscle in your body aches. Before you
        lies a desolate expanse of plain. In the distance, the alien spires of a warped city rise into the clouds.
        Behind you, the dark surface of the lake from which you’d emerged reflects the glare of two suns. When you
        peer back into the murky depths, you see no sign of the chapel where you’d made the leap, or of Mont
        Saint-Michel, or even of Earth. This is Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur reigns
        supreme.</string>
    <string name="dim_introduction_above">You land on a piece of black obsidian stone winding up a dark spire. You
        cough blood and feel a searing pain in your gut, as though you’d broken a rib. Before you lies a warped,
        alien city. Its twisting streets and aberrant architecture have no semblance of order or structure. In the
        distance, a murky lake reflects the glare of two suns. When you look up, the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel peeks
        just below the clouds, flipped upside-down. This is Carcosa—the realm of madness in the stars, where Hastur
        reigns supreme.</string>

    <string name="curtain_no_resolution">Once again you are startled awake, this time by the cold, clammy fingers of
        a hand on your shoulder. “Are you alright?” an elderly man asks, helping you to your feet. Your mind is a
        flurry of memories. Last you remember, the Ward Theatre had become a place of nightmares, filled with
        dangerous fanatics and strange terrors. Worried, you glance at your surroundings, only to find yourself on
        the rain-slicked curb outside the theatre. Despite the events from earlier, the city seems normal to your
        eyes—or at least, what passes as normal for Arkham. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as
        cars pass on the street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. The old man wears an
        expression of concern, noting the terror in your eyes. “Were you mugged? Damn those trouble boys!” he
        exclaims. “Dry-gulching folk on a night out to the the-a-tre! Not a single street those hooligans haven’t
        staked a claim on, I tell you.”\n
    \nYou stand and walk over to the front window of the Ward Theatre to tentatively peer through, but it is too dark
        to see anything inside. The elderly man eyes you curiously for a moment, then shrugs and continues walking.
        “Well, I’d best be on my way. I would do the same, if I were you,” he says, rounding the street corner. You
        quickly follow, hoping to warn him to stay away from the theatre. But when you turn the corner, it is not the
        elderly man you see, but the familiar sight of the Stranger in his featureless, pallid mask. His unwavering
        gaze bears down upon you. “Who are you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, but instead turns and
        disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by the time you
        reach the alleyway, it is empty—save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee entrance. “Don’t be
        a wet blanket! Come to <i>The King in Yellow</i> cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic
        Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you, frustrated and lost

        stack of paperwork, shakes his head and raises a finger in silence, then points to a nearby chair. The wait
        is excruciating. Every moment is an eternity. The hands of the nearby clock crawl. You drum your fingers on
        the desk. You tap your feet. You constantly peer over your shoulder to make sure the pallid mask of the
        Stranger is not watching you through the front window. Finally, the desk sergeant puts his pen down and sits
        up, beckoning you. “Alright, what’s so important now?” You are only halfway through your explanation of the
        night’s events when he sighs and shakes his head. “Look, if this is some kind of joke, it ain’t funny,” he
        says. “We had officers downtown all night. Don’t try to feed me some hooey straight to my face.” You insist,
        but the desk sergeant rises to his feet and opens the door, motioning for you to leave. He raises his voice.
        “What, you think we’re not busy enough or something? Beat it!” He mumbles about “blind birds” behind your
        back as he escorts you out of the station.\n
    \nYou <b>know</b> what you saw earlier that night. Frustrated, you head back to the Ward Theatre to find some
        kind of proof you can take to the police. You are surprised to find that the front door of the theatre is
        locked. You are about to decide whether or not to break down the door when you see a notice on the wall near
        the entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to <i>The King in Yellow</i> cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance
        Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and fold it into your

    <string name="curtain_resolution_two">You think about going to the police, but considering the horrors in the
        theatre, they’re more likely to think you’re mad than to believe your story. A small part of you wonders if
        this is still some kind of prank, but that can’t be the case—it was all too real, too terrifying to forget.
        Wondering what course of action to take, you find yourself backtracking over your escape route, returning to
        the theatre with cautious steps. The bright glare of headlights drills into your eyes as cars pass on the
        street, splashing dirty rainwater onto the sidewalk beside you. Soon the Ward Theatre comes into sight, its
        bright lights dominating the streets of Downtown. You expected the theatre to be in ruins, but its exterior
        looks the same as it did when you arrived to see <i>The King in Yellow</i> earlier that night. You walk to the front
        window of the Ward Theatre and tentatively peer through, but it is too dark to see anything inside.\n
    \nJust then, a chill brushes the nape of your neck, and you feel that you are being watched. You turn, and spot a
        shadow fleeing around the corner. A swarm of roaches skitters across the sidewalk, following in the shadow’s
        wake. Your muscles tense with uncertainty, and you round the corner in pursuit. Standing unconcerned on the
        sidewalk is a familiar-looking man in a featureless pallid mask.\n
    \nHis unwavering gaze bears down upon you. “Who are you?” you call out. The Stranger does not respond, and
        instead turns and disappears into the alleyway behind the theatre. You give chase, hoping for answers, but by
        the time you reach the alleyway, it is empty—save for a notice on the wall near the theatre’s employee
        entrance. “Don’t be a wet blanket! Come to <i>The King in Yellow</i> cast party. 8pm, at the home of Constance
        Dumaine, 1452 Atlantic Avenue. Formal dress only.” You tear the notice from the wall and take it with you,

    <string name="king_resolution_one">The brisk autumn air embraces you as you exit the manor. There is no doubt in
        your mind that the cast and crew of <i>The King in Yellow</i> have become affected by madness. Perhaps it’s getting
        to you, as well. You feel an encroaching darkness, a presence in your mind not unlike the gaze of the
        Stranger. Startled, you peer about the front yard for the first time since escaping the manor. The scene
        is…different. The front windows are not smashed as they were when you first approached. The trail of blood
        you had noticed on the porch has been wiped clean, and instead of the disturbingly warped music you had heard
        upon entering, the soothing tones of slow jazz drift out from the courtyard.\n

        but gone, and only a few guests remain. “Perhaps you would like for me to get your coat?” the server asks
        with a trained smile. You wobble as you rise to your feet, leaning against the couch’s armrest. Your head

        room is an old, faded map, bearing many fold creases and tattered edges. It looks to be an incomplete map of
        the catacombs beneath Paris, or at least a section of it. Mr. Engram returns moments later with hot tea and a
        plate of cheese and crackers. “I assume you are here to find the path to Carcosa?” he asks, wearing an
        excited grin. You shake your head in response, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He paces back and forth around
        the room as he speaks rapidly. “He told me that you would be arriving soon. That I should… Prepare.” Nigel
        turns toward you as he reaches the wooden door across from you, his eyes flashing. “Don’t worry. All is
        ready. The way is paved.” He opens the door to his study and steps inside, leaving you behind to interpret
        his cryptic comments. You wait a few minutes for him to return, but when he does not, you begin to worry.
        Then you notice that mold has already begun to grow over the cheese he’d brought you. “Mr. Engram?” you call
        out, and you hesitantly knock on the door to his study. There is no response. When you enter the room, you
        find him hanging from the ceiling fan, his body rotting from weeks of decomposition.\n

    <string name="phantom_resolution_three">As the sun rises once more over the skyline of Paris, you lose sight of
        the mysterious figure. Frustrated at your failure, you return to your hotel to sleep and recover from the
        horrors of the past few nights. Your fitful dreams return—dreams of Carcosa, of the King in Tatters, and of
        the shadowy figure whom you had pursued through the streets of Paris. When you awaken, you are no longer in
        your hotel room.\n

    <string name="pallid_no_resolution">You are shaken awake by a police officer and lifted to your feet. You feel as
        though the weight of a train has slammed into your head. The pain is unbearable. The man shines a flashlight
        in your eyes and asks you several questions in French. Dazed as you are, you find it difficult to answer. He
        points toward the staircase nearby and pushes you away from the catacombs. You stumble onto the Rue de la
        Tombe-Issoire and slowly make your way to a hotel where you can stay the night.\n
    \nSeveral days of research later, the meaning of the strange diagrams you saw within the catacombs still escapes
        you. You feel as though you have been led on a wild goose chase. Just as you are about to give up, you see a
        faded yellow book on the table nearest to you. You are stunned to discover that it is the unabridged script
        of <i>The King in Yellow</i>. Drawn on the cover in black ink is the very same diagram whose meaning you have
        been struggling to interpret for several sleepless nights. Who had placed it here? How had it come to your
        hotel room? Regardless, you know what you must do. The play holds the secrets—it has all along—and yet like a
        fool you have avoided reading Act II out of superstition. Its words cannot harm you any more than the
        creatures and fanatics you have already encountered. Trembling, you open to the second part, and begin to
        read.\n

            they gain insight into the machinations of the Tattered King.</b>\n

    <string name="pallid_resolution_one">The burned skull holds the key to everything. You are sure of it. You have
        tried every method available to you in studying the diagram it bears, but the answer eludes you still. You
        have brought the skull to experts, occultists, and professors. You have even tried speaking with the skull on
        more than one occasion. Exasperated, you place the skull on your night table and try to get some sleep for
        the first time since escaping the catacombs. As you fall asleep, you cannot shake the sight of the diagram
        etched in the skull’s forehead.\n
    \nYou awaken with a spark of inspiration and rush to the Musée du Louvre, a famous Parisian museum housing tens
        of thousands of paintings, drawings, and archaeological finds. You spend days exploring the museum—every
        display, every collection, every single object of art that might hold a clue to the diagram’s meaning.
        Finally, you see it: a painting depicting a beautiful island town weathering a torrential storm. Waves crash
        against the stone of the outer wall, the tide threatening to swallow the island whole. Lightning flashes
        around the tower of the abbey above the village. A whirlwind of black clouds churns in the sky above. The
        diagram from the burned skull you hold in your hands is recreated perfectly in the stained glass of the
        abbey. The title of the piece is “The Path Is Open.”\n

    <string name="pallid_resolution_two">You fall ceaselessly through the empty abyss. No air slows your descent or
        courses through your hair. It is a passageway devoid of reality. Finally, you pass through an invisible
        gateway and enter another realm. Looming above and below you are two skylines, one a warped reflection of the
        other. A vortex of swirling black clouds and crashing waves lies in between them. You study both sides—the
        familiar city and its strange mirror. Could this be the path to Carcosa? A passageway between realities,
        where realms converge? If so, all that is left is to find where this gate appears on Earth. You fall into the
        vortex below.\n
    \nYou are shaken awake by a police officer and lifted to your feet. You feel as though the weight of a train has
        slammed into your head. The pain is unbearable. The man shines a flashlight in your eyes and asks you several
        questions in French. Your eyes widen with realization and you wrest your arm free from the confused man’s
        grip. “I have to go at once!”\n

    <string name="black_stars_resolution_one">You hold your breath as you swim through freezing water toward the

        Saint-Michel’s abbey. No rain pelts the glass of the windows above, and you hear no thunder, nor the
        screeching of winged horrors overhead. Somehow, you had escaped the island’s certain doom. You creep to the
        door of the abbey and open it with trepidation. A dazzling light sears your eyes, and you lift your hand to
        block the glare of two suns. You stand overlooking the Lake of Hali. Black stars hang in the heavens above.
        Beyond, over leagues of tossing cloudwaves, the towers of Carcosa rise behind the shattered moon.\n

    <string name="dim_resolution_one">You stand atop the balcony of the abbey tower in Mont Saint-Michel, wet wind
        coursing through your hair. The Pallid Mask lies in your hands, devoid of warmth. You can scarcely bring
        yourself to look at it. You remember everything now—how it all began, how it ended, and everything in
        between. There is only one thing left to do. You hurl the mask into the air with all of your strength and
        watch as it flies into the tempest-tossed waves below.\n

    <string name="dim_resolution_two">A roar of applause startles you awake. The crowd of the theatre rises to their
        feet, cheering endlessly. Several patrons in the front row are throwing roses to the actors on stage, who are
        bowing with wide smiles across their faces. A searing headache crawls through your temples. How did you get
        back here? Were you in the theatre all along? What about the dinner party? The asylum? The catacombs?…
        Carcosa? Was it all just a terrible dream?\n
    \nYou exit the auditorium before the crowd rushes to do the same. Dizziness and exhaustion harries your senses.
        The weight of your lengthy investigation is crushing your mind. By the time you finally reach the lobby, you
        are clawing your way across the ground. Just then, a man in an elegant suit reaches down and grabs you by
        your arm, pulling you to your feet. You are about to thank him when you realize who he is. The sight of him
        causes you to stagger backward in horror momentarily. The actor who plays the role of the Stranger is still
        wearing his pale, featureless mask. He gives you a wordless bow, then turns and leaves through the Ward
        Theatre’s front entrance.\n

    \n“I’ve been looking all over for you!” You hear a voice exclaim behind you. You turn with a startle. For a

        you to Mont Saint-Michel stands at the edge of the steps, smiling at you. “Are you ready to head
